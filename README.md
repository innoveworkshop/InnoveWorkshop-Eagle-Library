# Innove Workshop Eagle Library

[Innove Workshop](http://innoveworkshop.com/)'s custom component
[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) 7.7 library.

This library is throughly documented inside Eagle and I must say it's pretty
nice to use and took a lot of effort to build. Enjoy!


## Components

List of components included in the library (might be out of date):

  - Frames
    - A4 Company Standard Frame
  - Operational Amplifiers
    - [LM258](https://www.ti.com/product/LM258)
  - Passives
    - Resistors
	- Capacitors
	- Inductors
  - Supplies
    - Whatever Eagle gives you plus a lot more

## Compatibility

Everything you see here was designed for use with Eagle 7.7, we've standardized
on this version and we'll **never** update to a newer bloated version of Eagle.
This will probably work on newer versions, but your mileage may vary.
