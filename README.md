# Innove Workshop Eagle Library

[Innove Workshop](http://innoveworkshop.com/)'s custom component
[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) 7.7 library.

This library only contains *extremely high quality* symbols and footprints, is
throughly documented inside Eagle, and took a lot of effort to build. Enjoy!

Everything you see here was designed for use with Eagle 7.7, we've standardized
on this version and we'll **never** update to a newer bloated version of Eagle.
This will probably work on newer versions, but your mileage may vary.
