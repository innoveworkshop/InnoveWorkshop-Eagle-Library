This library comes with design rules for the following PCB manufacturers:

  - SeeedStudio
  - JLCPCB


## CAM Jobs

With this library you'll be able to generate Gerbers for the following PCB
manufacturers:

  - SeeedStudio


# User Language Programs

You'll also be able to automate some tasks with these amazing programs:

## Compatibility

Everything you see here was designed for use with Eagle 7.7, we've standardized
on this version and we'll **never** update to a newer bloated version of Eagle.
This will probably work on newer versions, but your mileage may vary.
